WINDOW [x1,y1,x2,y2]

The WINDOW command allows you to redefine the corners of the display screen as a pair of "world" coordinates. WINDOW is also overloaded as a function, returning a system object providing access to the following sub-commands: graphicsScreen1, graphicsScreen2, textScreen, alert, ask, menu, message, showKeypad, insetTextScreen


<p>The world space defined by WINDOW is disabled by a WINDOW command with no parameters.

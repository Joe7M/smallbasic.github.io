' RND - returns a number from 0 to almost 1
' IFF - IFF(conditional statement to evaluate, return this if evaluates true, returns this if evaluates false) 
' DEF - one line function definition
FOR i=1 TO 20 'need a random true/false, subst 0 or 1 (or -1)  ;)
  ? IFF(rnd<.5,"True ","False ");   '<======================== RND and IFF

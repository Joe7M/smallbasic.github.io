LINEQN (a, b [, toler])

Returns an array with the values of the unknowns. This function solves equations using the Gauss-Jordan method.


* b equations
* b results
* toler tolerance number. (the absolute value of the lowest acceptable number) default = 0 = none...
|x| <= toler : x = 0
The result is a matrix Nx1. The array is two-dimension array.

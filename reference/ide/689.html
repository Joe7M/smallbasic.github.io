<blockquote>
<p>REPEAT … UNTIL expr</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Begins the definition of a REPEAT/UNTIL loop.</p>
<p>SmallBASIC starts executing the commands between the REPEAT and UNTIL
commands. When SmallBASIC encounters the UNTIL command, it evaluates the
expression parameter <code>expr</code>. If that parameter is zero
(false), the process will be repeated; otherwise, execution continues at
the next command. The REPEAT/UNTIL loop evaluates the expression at the
end of the loop. Therefore at least one loop is performed.</p>
<p>REPEAT/UNTIL loops may be nested to any level of complexity, but
there must be an UNTIL for each REPEAT.</p>
<p>See WHILE…WEND loop if you want to evaluate the expression at the
begin of the loop.</p>
<h3 id="example">Example</h3>
<pre><code>C = 1
REPEAT
    PRINT C
    C = C + 1
UNTIL C == 10

&#39; Output: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9</code></pre>

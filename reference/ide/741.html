<blockquote>
<p>POLYAREA (poly)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Returns the area of the polyline poly. The algebraic sign of the area is positive for counterclockwise ordering of vertices in x-y plane; otherwise negative.</p>

Area = abs(polyarea(polygon))     &#39; absolute value of the area, because
                                  &#39; we are not interested in the
                                  &#39; ordering of the vertices.

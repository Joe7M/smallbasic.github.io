<h1 id="include">INCLUDE</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>INCLUDE SourceFile</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Inserts code from SourceFile when the program is compiled.</p>
<p>INCLUDE can be used to split a large file into smaller parts. If you
want to use include to create a library, then you should consider to use
an UNIT instead.</p>
<h3 id="example">Example</h3>
<p>Create first file and save it as part1.bas.</p>
<pre><code>Print &quot;This is part1.bas&quot;
for i = 1 to 5
  print i
next</code></pre>
<p>Create second file wich will include part1.bas.</p>
<pre><code>include part1.bas

print &quot;This is part2.bas&quot;
for i = 5 to 1 step -1
    print i
next

&#39; Output:
&#39; This is part1.bas
&#39; 1 2 3 4 5
&#39; This is part2.bas
&#39; 5 4 3 2 1</code></pre>

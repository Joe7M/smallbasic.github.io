<h1 id="include">INCLUDE</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>INCLUDE source-file.bas</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Inserts code in the named file when the program is compiled.</p>
<p>INCLUDE is not in the main list for the Language reference. But here it is, right after IMPORT under the System category! Here is part_1.bas, the first part of our long program:</p>
<pre><code>
&#39; &quot;part_1.bas&quot; demo file for INCLUDE keyword.
Label startProgram
Print &quot;i is: &quot;; i
</code></pre>
<p>Here is part_2.bas, the second (and startup) part of our long program:</p>
<pre><code>
&#39; &quot;part_2.bas&quot; demo file for INCLUDE keyword - This is the startup file
&#39; to run the demo program.
&#39; -------------
&#39; Include keyword allows us to merge another SmallBASIC source file into 
&#39; our file, which means that any code is common to all files.
&#39; It&#39;s useful when the program is too long and we simply want to divide it
&#39; into &quot;pages&quot;, instead of one single long &quot;page&quot;.
&#39; 
&#39; See also Home -- Language reference -- Graphics -- COLOR -- color_const.bas
&#39; for practical example of Include.
&#39;
&#39; Note: INCLUDE keyword is very different from UNIT keyword. 
&#39;       UNIT allows us to use only specific code, therefore it is more suitable 
&#39;       for modular programming.
&#39;       UNIT also supports &quot;Namespaces&quot;: Namespaces allow reuse of same names 
&#39;       in different contexts. e.g. BitLib.Set(x) and StrLib.Set(x) are both 
&#39;       using a function with the same name, &quot;Set&quot;, but in different contexts.
&#39; -------------

&#39; Here we include (merge) another file in our program:
&#39; Note: actuall filename must be lower case for Linux.
Include &quot;part_1.bas&quot; 

&#39; demo:
i += 1
If i &lt;= 10 Then Goto startProgram &#39; startProgram label is in part_1.bas
Pause

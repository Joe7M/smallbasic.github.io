?&quot;A man put up a pole (blue) and attached a 100 foot wire (red)&quot;
?&quot;from top to ground. Now he needs to know the height of the&quot;
?&quot;pole. He doesn&#39;t have a ladder nearly that high but he&quot;
?&quot;can use a first lesson in trignometry to get the height of&quot;
?&quot;the pole.&quot;
?
?&quot;Trignometry means right triangles. A right triangle is one
?&quot;that contains a 90 degree angle, the same angle a proper 
?&quot;pole makes with the ground.&quot;
?
?&quot;Trig has made a study of right triangles and made one big
?&quot;discovery: The RATIO of the sides of a right triangle are 
?&quot;always the same if the ANGLES of the sides (AKA legs and 
?&quot;hypotenuse) are the same.&quot; 
?&quot;That is trig in a nutshell. Notice I said RATIO of lengths.&quot;
?
?&quot;press any when ready...

?&quot;The two main RATIOs of Trig are SIN and COS.&quot;
?&quot;COS (AKA COSINE) is the RATIO of the green side (next to&quot;
?&quot;the yellow ANGLE) to the hypotenuse (red diagonal) AKA&quot;  
?&quot;(adjacent leg) / (hypotenuse)  shortened to (adj/hyp)&quot;
?&quot;or here (green line length) / (red line length).&quot;
?&quot;That&#39;s it!  COS is the leg length next to the angle in&quot;
?&quot;question divided by the diagonal length.&quot;
?
?&quot;So the man measures the distance from the pole to where&quot;
?&quot;the wire meets the gound and gets 50 feet. This is the&quot;
?&quot;green leg next to the angle we want to figure out for the&quot;
?&quot;COS RATIO (adj/hyp). In this case it is 50 ft along the&quot; 
?&quot;ground divided by 100 ft the diagonal red wire, 50/100=.5&quot; 
?&quot;So that means COS of the angle is .5 the man says.&quot;
?
?&quot;So the man goes to some trig tables and finds what angle&quot;
?&quot;makes a COS ratio of .5, he is looking up the Arc COS of&quot;
?&quot;the ratio(.5) = the angle whose adj-leg/hypotenuse is .5&quot; 
?&quot;Oh! he says that is a 60 degree angle the wire is making&quot;
?&quot;with the ground, the yellow angle is 60 degrees.&quot;
?
?&quot;Press any key when ready...&quot;
Pause

?&quot;Now that he knows the angle is 60 degrees he can use the&quot;
?&quot;SIN ratio to calculate the height of the pole. The SIN&quot;
?&quot;RATIO is opp/hyp, the (opposite leg length)/(hypotenuse)&quot;
?&quot;The pole/wire = SIN of 60 degrees = .8660&quot;
?&quot;or pole/wire=.866.&quot;
?
?&quot;Multiply both sides of this equation by wire length and&quot; 
?&quot;get pole=.866*wire.&quot;
?&quot;Since the wire is 100, pole = .866*100 = 86.6 feet.&quot;

<p>At an angle around a given point, SIN and COS and radius (or distance) can locate the absolute screen x,y coordinate.</p>
<pre><code>&#39; Diagrammed SIN and COS.bas  SmallBASIC 0.12.2 [B+=MGA] 2016-03-16
&#39; ah finally got diagramed analysis built into single quote commented code!!!
&#39; the color codes match original Trig lesson one
&#39; reminder XMAX, YMAX and PI are built in constants
CONST green =RGB(0,128,0)
&#39; a central point cx,cy around which to draw 
cx=XMAX/2:cy=YMAX/2 &#39;again cx,cy can be anywhere on screen so dont make them constant
&#39; highlight center
CIRCLE cx,cy,2,1,15
r=200 &#39;the radius or distance in pixels from cx,cy desired
CIRCLE cx,cy,r,1,8  &#39;we want a point somewhere on this circle, radius = constant distance away from point
&#39; locate point 30 degrees and r distance from cx,cy       30 degrees = PI/6 radians
&#39; here is 30 degrees in tiny purple circle around x=r*cos(rad(30),y=r*sin(rad(30)

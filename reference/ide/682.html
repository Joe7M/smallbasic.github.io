<h1 id="goto">GOTO</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>GOTO label</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Causes program execution to branch to a specified position (label).</p>
<p>GOTO is known to create “spaghetti code”, i.e. winding code which is hard to follow, to understand, and to maintain. IF…THEN, SELELCT CASE, SUB, FUNC and DEF are much better ways to write branching code.</p>

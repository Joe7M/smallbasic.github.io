&#39; ENV test.bas  SmallBASIC 0.12.2 [B+=MGA] 2016-04-10
&#39;OK this works 
&#39;OK this is supposed to return an array of my Environment variables
EVS=ENV(&quot;&quot;)
for e in EVS
  ? e
next
?:? &quot;press any...&quot;
pause
&#39;wow it worked! I have a load of them...
&#39;OK now try and set one of my own
cls
myEV1=&quot;This is a test of ENV.&quot;
ENV &quot;myEV1=&quot;+myEV1
&#39;did it get added to list?
EVS=ENV(&quot;&quot;)
for e in EVS
  ? e
next
?:? &quot;press any...&quot;
pause
&#39;YES!
&#39;OK let&#39;s see it 
myEV1return=ENV(&quot;myEV1&quot;)
cls
? myEV1return
?:? &quot;press any...&quot;
pause
&#39;now can we erase it?
ENV &quot;myEV1=&quot;
cls
? &quot;myEV1 should be erased, it is now &#39;&quot;;ENV(&quot;myEV1&quot;);&quot;&#39;&quot;
?:? &quot;Test of ENV is complete.&quot;
pause
&#39;yes, it was erased because when I ran same code a second time, it wasn&#39;t there THEN!
&#39; so it didn&#39;t just LOOK erased from a bad call

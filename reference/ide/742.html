<blockquote>
<p>POLYCENT(polygon)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>returns the centroid of a polygon.</p>
<p>Polycent is based on code from the article “Centroid of a Polygon” by Gerard Bashein and Paul R. Detmer.</p>
<p>Polycent calculates the centroid (xCentroid, yCentroid) and area of a polygon, given its vertices (x[0], y[0]) … (x[n-1], y[n-1]). It is assumed that the contour is closed, i.e., that the vertex following (x[n-1], y[n-1]) is (x[0], y[0]). The algebraic sign of the area is positive for counterclockwise ordering of vertices in x-y plane; otherwise negative.</p>

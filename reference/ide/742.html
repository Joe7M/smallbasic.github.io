<h1 id="polycent">POLYCENT</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>c = POLYCENT(poly)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>returns the centroid of a polygon <code>poly</code> as an array. The first element contains the x- the second element contains the y-coordinate of the centroid. POLYCENT will return an empty array if the area of the polygon is zero and the centroid is undefined.</p>
<p>POLYCENT is based on code from the article “Centroid of a Polygon” by Gerard Bashein and Paul R. Detmer.</p>
<p>See DRAWPOLY for more information on how to define the polygon.</p>
<h3 id="example">Example:</h3>
<pre><code>polygon = [[50,50], [100,50], [100,100], [50,100], [50,50]]

&#39; Calculate centroid
centroid = polycent(polygon)  
print &quot;Centroid is at: &quot;; centroid

&#39; Draw polygon and a circle at position of the centroid
drawpoly polygon color 12
circle centroid(0), centroid(1) , 5 color 5</code></pre>

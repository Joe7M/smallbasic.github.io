<p>Solves linear equations using the Gauss-Jordan method.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>A</code> equation coefficience as a matrix</li>
<li><code>B</code> results of the equations as a column-vector</li>
<li><code>C</code> result as a Nx1 matrix with the values of the
unknowns</li>
<li><code>toler</code> tolerance number (the absolute value of the
lowest acceptable number). Default value is <code>0</code> (tolerance
not applied).</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>One possible problem is numerical instability, caused by the
possibility of dividing by very small numbers. If, for example, the
leading coefficient of one of the rows is very close to zero, [â€¦] one
would need to divide by that number. This means that any error existed
for the number that was close to zero would be amplified. <a

<p>The tolerance number can be used to ensure, that no division by
numbers smaller than <code>toler</code> will be performed.</p>
<h3 id="example">Example</h3>
<pre><code>&#39; Solve:
&#39;  x -  y + 2z =  6
&#39; 2x + 3y + 2z = 11
&#39; 3x + 2y +  z =  8

A = [1,-1,2; 2,3,2; 3,2,1]
B = [6; 11; 8]

C = LINEQN(A, B)

print &quot;x = &quot;; C(0,0)
print &quot;y = &quot;; C(0,1)
print &quot;z = &quot;; C(0,2)

&#39; Output: x = 1; y = 1; z = 3</code></pre>

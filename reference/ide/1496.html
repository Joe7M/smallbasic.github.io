<p>result = LSHIFT number, amount</p>

<p>Performs an arithmetic left shift on a bit pattern.</p>
<pre><code>
&#39; Tested on 32-bit system (I&#39;m not sure yet about the result on 64-bit system):
x = 1                 &#39; x = 1 (0b1)
? Bin(x)
?
x = x Lshift 1        &#39; Shift-Left x by 1
? Bin(x)
x = x Lshift 30       &#39; Shift-Left x again by 30
? Bin(x)
?
x = 1 Lshift 33        &#39; The same as: x = 1 Lshift (33 Mod 32)
? Bin(x)
?
x = 0b1111 Lshift 30   &#39; The two upper bits are lost (on 32-bit system)
? Bin(x)
? x                    &#39; x is -1073741824  (on 32-bit system)

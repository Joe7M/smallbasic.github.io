<h1 id="def">DEF</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>DEF name[(par1[,â€¦])] = expression</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Defines a single line function. eg, DEF MySin(x) = SIN(x): ? MySin(pi/2)</p>
<p>This might come in handy sometime.</p>
<pre><code>
&#39; RND - returns a number from 0 to almost 1
&#39; DEF - one line function definition
&#39;A function for random numbers (integers) between low and high (inclusive)
&#39;here is that function
DEF rand(lo,hi)=(RND*(hi-lo+1))\\1+lo &#39;&lt;======================= RND and DEF
&#39;test the distribution of these numbers with 1000 trials
low=1100:high=1150
DIM a(low-1 TO high+1)
FOR i=1 to 1000
  index=rand(low,high)
  a(index)++
NEXT
total=0
FOR i=low-1 TO high+1
  ? i;&quot;:&quot;;a(i);&quot;, &quot;;
  total+=a(i)
  IF i MOD 10=9 THEN ?
NEXT
?:? &quot;total trials=&quot;;total
&#39;result: pretty even spread between two numbers inclusive.

&#39; DEF and LOCAL.bas  SmallBASIC 0.12.2 [B+=MGA] 2016-04-06
&#39;can I use DEF locally in a sub without interfering with main variable or DEF names
def aboutMe() = &quot;I am texting from main code.&quot;
? &quot;Hi, &quot;;aboutMe
mySub
? &quot;Goodbye, &quot;;aboutMe
pause
sub mySub()
  &#39;local def aboutMe() = &quot;I am texting from mySub.&quot; &#39;&lt;=== note: this did not work 
  local aboutMe
  def aboutMe() = &quot;I am texting from mySub.&quot;
? &quot;Hi, &quot;;aboutMe

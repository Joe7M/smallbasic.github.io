<p>The THROW command (previously known as RTE) is used to initiate a catch-able error. If there is no surrounding TRY/CATCH block, THROW can be used to abort the program.</p>
<p><em>Summary</em> TRY/CATCH is used to trap errors allowing a program to recover without having to be restarted.</p>
<pre><code>TRY</code></pre>
<p>The TRY statement introduces a TRY/CATCH BLOCK.</p>
<pre><code>CATCH [var | expr]</code></pre>
<p>The CATCH statement is used to CATCH an run-time error. This is typically used with errors raised when calling a file system command that cannot be completed, for example attempting to open a non-existent file.</p>
<p>The CATCH statement has two modes. You can supply a variable argument to store the error string. Alternatively you can supply an expression. When the raised error matches the (String) expression, the error will be caught.</p>
<p>When using the expression mode, you can supply a succession of CATCH statements to handle various error messages separately. END TRY</p>
<p>The END TRY statement marks the end of a TRY/CATCH block.</p>
<pre><code>THROW</code></pre>
<p>The THROW command (previously known as RTE) is used to initiate a catch-able error. If there is no surrounding TRY/CATCH block, THROW can be used to abort the program.</p>
<p>Example</p>
<pre><code>
try
 open &quot;com2000:&quot; AS #1
catch err
  ? &quot;in catch: open failed&quot;;err
end try

<blockquote>
<p>ATAN2 (x, y)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Inverse tangent (x,y).</p>
<pre><code>
&#39;Both atan(n) and atan2(y, x) return an angle measured in radians.
&#39;The return measure is from -pi to pi. In demo below it is converted
&#39;to angle between 0 and 360 degrees.
&#39;atan2 is better for detecting angle&#39;s quardrant because 
&#39;x and y are given separartely.
&#39;y the vertical change is given first.

  if a &lt; 0 then a += 2 * pi  
  &#39;^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  if want a = 0 to 2*pi, instead of -pi to pi

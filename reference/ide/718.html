y = 100                      &#39; Adjacent side of right-angled triangle

<pre><code>&#39; Both atan(n) and atan2(y, x) return an angle measured in radians.
&#39; The return measure is from -pi to pi. In demo below it is converted
&#39; to angle between 0 and 360 degrees.
&#39; atan2 is better for detecting angle&#39;s quardrant because 
&#39; x and y are given separartely.
&#39; y the vertical change is given first.

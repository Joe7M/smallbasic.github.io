<h1 id="window">WINDOW</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>WINDOW [x1,y1,x2,y2]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The WINDOW command allows you to redefine the corners of the display screen as a pair of “world” coordinates. WINDOW is also overloaded as a function, returning a system object providing access to the following sub-commands: graphicsScreen1, graphicsScreen2, textScreen, alert, ask, menu, message, showKeypad, insetTextScreen</p>
<p>The world space defined by WINDOW is disabled by a WINDOW command with no parameters.</p>
<p>This is a demo from http://smallbasic.sourceforge.net/?q=comment/1502#comment-1502 It shows how to use the additional WINDOW sub-commands (It is not the traditional use of WINDOW [x1,y1,x2,y2] ). Tested with SmallBASIC version 0.12.6 (Linux).</p>
<pre><code>
&#39; create the window object, this provides access to a number of sub-commands
w = window()
&#39; select graphics mode screen 1 for output
w.graphicsScreen1()
for i = 0 to 10
  print &quot;this is printed on screen 1&quot;
next i
w.message(&quot;[1] click to continue. &quot;)
pause
&#39; select graphics mode screen 1 for output
w.graphicsScreen2()
color 1,3
cls
print &quot;this is printed on screen 2&quot;
w.message(&quot;[2] click to continue. &quot;)
pause
w.graphicsScreen1()
print &quot;back to screen 1&quot;
w.message(&quot;[3] click to continue. &quot;)
pause
&#39; select the text mode for output
&#39; text mode can display more text but is slow 
&#39; also this is currently broken and will cause a crash 
&#39;w.textScreen()
w.alert(&quot;This is an alert&quot;, &quot;title&quot;)
w.ask(&quot;Yes or no?&quot;, &quot;Question&quot;)
print &quot;your answer was &quot;; w.answer
w.message(&quot;[4] click to continue. &quot;)
pause
w.menu(&quot;option1&quot;, &quot;option2&quot;, &quot;option3&quot;)
&#39; weirdly the result is sent to the keyboard handler
&#39; it should at least go to w.answer. also there is no option for placement
select case asc(inkey)
case 0
  print &quot;one&quot;
case 1
  print &quot;two&quot;
case 2
  print &quot;three&quot;
case else
  print &quot;unk&quot;
end select
w.message(&quot;[5] click to continue. &quot;)
pause
&#39; this raises the virtual keypad on android
w.showKeypad()
&#39; set the font size 
&#39; arg1 = size 
&#39; arg2 = unit amount for size, &quot;px&quot; or &quot;em&quot;
&#39;   px=  pixels
&#39;   em= emphasis - this is a multiplication factor for the current size
&#39; arg3= bold 1=on 0=off
&#39; arg4= italic 1=on, 0=off
&#39; this sets the font to be double in size with bold and italic
&#39; using pixels is likely to give an unexpected result in android
w.setFont(2, &quot;em&quot;, 1,1)
cls
? &quot;How does this look?&quot;
w.insetTextScreen(5,10,90,90)
for i = 0 to 200
  ? &quot;This is in the text screen&quot;
next i
&#39; comment out the above cls to see the bug
w.message(&quot;spot the bug  ?&quot;)
w.setFont(11, &quot;px&quot;, 0,0)
? &quot;press a key to end...&quot;
pause
</code></pre>

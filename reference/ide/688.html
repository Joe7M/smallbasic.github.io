<p>The <code>#</code> character can only be used as remarks if it is the first character of the line.</p>

<pre><code>&#39; Although the code is very short (less then thousands of lines...), it&#39;s
&#39; almost impossible to decode it... - That&#39;s why comments are so useful:
&#39; to remind *yourself* and others what you did and why.
&#39; Let&#39;s try to analyze &quot;Curlie borealis.bas&quot; code and add few comments to it:

&#39; --- Start of &quot;Curlie borealis.bas&quot; + Comments:
&#39; Initialize variables for the main loop:
Randomize           &#39; - I&#39;m not sure why do we need it here... (MGA?)
ff = 440.03         &#39; Factor for defining x,y location to draw point
maxi = 25000        &#39; Maximum points to draw in each shape
maxi2 = maxi \ 2    &#39; Factor for defining two different color schemes in shape
b = Rgb(40, 20, 30) &#39; Background color
Color 0, b
Cls
&#39; Run program in an endless loop (Press Ctrl+B or Ctrl+C to stop):
While 1
  ff += 9.444 &#39; Move the next shape to different x,y location

  &#39; Draw a single shape using two color schemes, or draw an invisible shape:
  For i = 0 To maxi
    &#39; Define location (x,y) to draw a single point:
    f += ff
    x = Min(xmax, -x + Cos(f * i)) &#39; (MIN makes sure location is within screen)
    y = Min(ymax, -y + Sin(f * i))

    &#39; Define nice color to draw a point:
    If cc Mod 6 = 0 Then
      If i &lt; maxi2 Then &#39; One color scheme
        c = Rgb(255 - 255 * i \ maxi2, 255 * i \ maxi2, 0)
      Else              &#39; Second color scheme
        c = Rgb(0, 255 - 255 * (i - maxi2) \ maxi2, 255 * (i - maxi2) \ maxi2)
      Fi
    Else
      c = b &#39; Use background color to draw invisible shape
    Fi

    &#39; Draw a single point (pixel):
    Pset x, y, c
    If i Mod 5000 = 0 Then Showpage &#39; Update screen each 5000 points (smoother)
  Next
  cc++ &#39; Counter for drawing invisible shape (using background color)
Wend
&#39; --- End of &quot;Curlie borealis.bas&quot; + Comments

&#39; To sum up:
&#39; Whether you write a short program or long, comments will help you
&#39; and others to understand, debug and improve your program later on; i.e.
&#39; comments make your code useful!

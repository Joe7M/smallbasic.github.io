<blockquote>
<p>JULIAN (dmy| (d,m,y))</p>

<p>Returns the Julian date. (dates must be greater than 1/1/100 AD).</p>
<pre><code>PRINT Julian(DATE)
PRINT Julian(31, 12, 2001)</code></pre>
<p>Earlier this month I had done some code to calculate Oil Tank usage and used a ridiculously long and complex formula for calculating the number of days between two dates. I should have used the julian date function:</p>
<pre><code>
REM julian demo.bas 2016-02-28 SmallBASIC 0.12.2 [B+=MGA]
&#39;oh julian returns the number of days since 1/1/100
&#39;it is perfect for calculating the number of days between two dates
&#39;but the date given to the julian function must be in form dd/mm/yyyy or m,d,y (see help)
&#39;Date just so happens also returns in dd/mm/yyyy format so...
? &quot;Today is &quot;;date
input &quot;To test what julian returns, enter a date dd/mm/yyyy &quot;;adate
? &quot;julian(&quot;;adate;&quot;) returns: &quot;;julian(adate)
? &quot;That is/was &quot;;abs(julian(adate)-julian(date));&quot; days from today.&quot;
?:input &quot;To test the other format julian accepts enter a date as: dd,mm,yyyy(enter) &quot;;d,m,y
? &quot;That is/was &quot;;abs(julian(d,m,y)-julian(date));&quot; days from today.&quot;
?:? &quot;Again julian is excellent for calculating the number of days between two dates.&quot;
pause
end

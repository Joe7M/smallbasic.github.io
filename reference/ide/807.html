<h1 id="env">ENV</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>ENV expr</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Adds a variable to or deletes a variable from the current environment variable-table.</p>
<p>ENV can be used as SUB for setting or erasing Environment Variables (EV) and ENV can be used as a FUNCtion for returning a particular EV or the whole set of them into an array using: EVarray=ENV("")</p>

&#39; ENV test.bas  SmallBASIC 0.12.2 [B+=MGA] 2016-04-10
&#39;OK this works
&#39;OK this is supposed to return an array of my Environment variables
EVS=ENV(&quot;&quot;)
for e in EVS
  ? e
next
?:? &quot;press any...&quot;
pause
&#39;wow it worked! I have a load of them...
&#39;OK now try and set one of my own
cls
myEV1=&quot;This is a test of ENV.&quot;
ENV &quot;myEV1=&quot;+myEV1
&#39;did it get added to list?
EVS=ENV(&quot;&quot;)
for e in EVS
  ? e
next
?:? &quot;press any...&quot;
pause
&#39;YES!
&#39;OK let&#39;s see it
myEV1return=ENV(&quot;myEV1&quot;)
cls
? myEV1return
?:? &quot;press any...&quot;
pause
&#39;now can we erase it?
ENV &quot;myEV1=&quot;
cls
? &quot;myEV1 should be erased, it is now &#39;&quot;;ENV(&quot;myEV1&quot;);&quot;&#39;&quot;
?:? &quot;Test of ENV is complete.&quot;
pause
&#39;yes, it was erased because when I ran same code a second time, it wasn&#39;t there THEN!
&#39; so it didn&#39;t just LOOK erased from a bad call
</code></pre>
<pre><code>ENV &quot;myEV1=&quot;</code></pre>
<p>does not erase the variable on Linux… On Linux I could only erase the variable from a terminal:</p>
<pre><code>unset $myEV1</code></pre>
<p>In general: 1. Never use names which are already used by the system or another process, such as “PATH”, “HOME”, “PWD”, etc. You can check which variable names are already used, from SmallBASIC:</p>
<pre><code>? Environ(&quot;&quot;)</code></pre>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Use short and unique names, such as: “SB1”, SB2" or “SBv1”, “SBv2”, etc. It will keep the environment-variables-table readable, and will save space in the table.</li>
<li>Don’t create more variables then you need. Reuse any variable which is not used. i.e. if “SB1” is unused anymore, then reuse it:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>Environ &quot;SB1=5&quot;</code></pre>
<p>. Again, it keeps the environment-variables-table readable, and saves space in the table. 4. On some systems the environment-variables-table is unique for each session (Linux for example) and this may be a bit confusing. 5. Environment variables may or may not be case sensitive, i.e. “SB1” may be different then “sb1” on some systems (Linux for example).</p>

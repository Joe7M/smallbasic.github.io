<h1 id="run">RUN</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>[s =] RUN cmdstr</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Loads a secondary copy of the system shell and executes a program or
a shell command given by the string <code>cmdstr</code>. The execution
of the calling BASIC program will be stoped and control returns to the
BASIC program once the system command has completed. If RUN is called as
a function, the return value <code>s</code> holds the text output of the
executed command as a string.</p>
<p>System commands, especially on Linux, are very powerful, and can add
lots of valuable features to a SmallBASIC program. With system commands
you can configure the COM port, send email (Linux at least), get lots of
information about the environment, etc.</p>
<p>In the Android version you can use <code>s = RUN</code> to look at
information in the /proc file system.</p>
<p>See EXEC if control should return to the BASIC program
immediately.</p>
<h2 id="use-run-in-windows">Use RUN in Windows</h2>
<p>In Windows (tested with Win10) you have to call the programm
<code>cmd</code> which opens a command line window. The command you want
to execute will be a parameter of <code>cmd</code>. Additional the
parameter <code>/C</code> needs to be added to quit the command line
window after execution of the command.</p>
<h3 id="example-1-run-as-a-function">Example 1: RUN as a function</h3>
<pre><code>s = run(&quot;cmd /C dir&quot;)                              &#39; Execute DIR and
print s                                            &#39; print a list of files in the current directory

s = run(&quot;cmd /C copy rename.txt rename1.txt&quot;)      &#39; Copy a file (please create the file rename.txt before testing)
print s                                            &#39; Prints the text output of copy</code></pre>
<h3 id="example-2-run-as-procedure">Example 2: RUN as procedure</h3>
<pre><code>run(&quot;cmd /C copy rename.txt rename1.txt&quot;)          &#39; Copy a file (please create the file rename.txt before testing)
    
run(&quot;cmd /C notepad.exe&quot;)                          &#39; Start Notepad and wait until Notepad was closed        </code></pre>
<h2 id="use-run-in-linux">Use RUN in Linux</h2>
<p>Commands to execute are case sensitive in Linux. Each command shell
has an unique environment-variables-table; which means that you cannot
always share environment variables with commands executed by RUN.</p>

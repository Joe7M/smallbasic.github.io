<h1 id="for">FOR</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>FOR expr</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Defines a FOR/NEXT loop. FOR counter = start TO end [STEP incr] … NEXT. FOR element IN array (or map) … NEXT.</p>
<p>Begins the definition of a FOR/NEXT loop. * counter - A numeric variable to be used as the loop counter. * start - A numeric expression; the starting value of counter. * end - A numeric expression; the ending value of counter. * incr - A numeric expression; the value by which counter is incremented or decremented with each iteration of the loo The default value is +1.</p>
<p>SmallBASIC begins processing of the FOR/NEXT block by setting counter equal to start. Then, if ‘incr’ is positive and counter is not greater than end, the commands between the FOR and the NEXT are executed.</p>
<p>When the NEXT is encountered, counter is increased by ‘incr’, and the process is repeated. Execution passes to the command following the NEXT if counter is greater than end.</p>
<p>If increment is negative, execution of the FOR/NEXT loop is terminated whenever counter becomes less than end. FOR/NEXT loops may be nested to any level of complexity, but there must be a NEXT for each FOR.</p>

FOR C=1 TO 9
    PRINT C
NEXT

<p><em>Statement FOR element IN array … NEXT</em> Begins the definition of a FOR/NEXT loop. * element - A variable to be used as the copy of the current element. * array - An array expression The commands-block will repeated for LEN(array) times. Each time the ‘element’ will holds the value of the current element of the array. FOR/NEXT loops may be nested to any level of complexity, but there must be a NEXT for each FOR.</p>
<pre><code>
A=[1,2,3]
FOR E IN A
    PRINT E
NEXT
...
&#39; This is the same with that
A=[1,2,3]
FOR I=LBOUND(A) TO UBOUND(A)
    E=A(I)
    PRINT E
NEXT

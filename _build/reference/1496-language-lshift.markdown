# LSHIFT

> result = x LSHIFT n

Performs a bitwise operation that shifts all the bits of `x` to the left by an amount of `n`.

### Example 1:

```
print 1 lshift 2            ' Output 4
```

### Example 2:

```
x = 1 
print bin(x)                ' Output: 1
print bin(x lshift 1)       ' Output: 10
print bin(x lshift 2)       ' Output: 100
print bin(x lshift 3)       ' Output: 1000
```

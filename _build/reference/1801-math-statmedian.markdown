# STATMEDIAN

> f = STATMEDIAN (var1 [, var2, ... ,varN])

The median of a finite list of numbers is the "middle" number, when those numbers are listed in order from smallest to greatest. `var1` to `varN` can be single numbers or arrays.

see: [Wikipedia - Median](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median)

### Example

```
a = [1, 3, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9]
print statmedian(a)   ' output: 6
```

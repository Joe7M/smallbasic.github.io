# TRANSPOSE

> A = TRANSPOSE (M)

Calculates the transpose `A` of a 2D matrix or a vector `M`.

### Example 1: Transpose of a vetor

```
A = [1;2;3;4]
print transpose(A)   ' output: [1,2,3,4]
```

### Example 2: Transpose of a matrix

```
A = [1,2; 3,4; 5,6]
print transpose(A)   ' output: [1,3,5;2,4,6] 
```

# CONST

> CONST name = expr

Declare a variable `name` who's value does not change during program execution. `name` follows the rules for naming SmallBASIC variables. `expr` is an expression consisting of literals, with or without operators, only.

### Example

```
CONST G = 6.67259E-11
CONST PISQUARE = PI^2
```

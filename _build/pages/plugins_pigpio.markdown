# SmallBASIC-PiGPIO - Plugin to use the GPIO pins of a Raspberry Pi

![](https://joe7m.github.io/SmallBasicPIGPIO/images/logo_smallbasicpigpio.png)

SmallBASIC-PiGPIO is a plugin for SmallBASIC to use the GPIO connector of a Raspberry Pi.
The following article will give you a short introduction to the plugin. Detailed information
is available on the [project website](https://joe7m.github.io/smallbasic.pigpio2/index.html)

## Blinking LED

In this example we will connect a LED to the Raspberry Pi and let it blink with a short
SmallBASIC program.

### Wiring

The wiring of the LED is shown in the following image

Depending on the type of the LED you need a certain resistor. When using the LED without
a resistor, you will destroy the LED and maybe even parts of your Raspberry Pi. If you
want to see your LED blinking without studying to much and you donâ€™t expect maximum
brightness, then go for a resistor with 220 Ohms or even (saver) 1000 Ohms.

Connect the resistor to pin 7 (GPIO4) and the LED to ground of the Raspberry Pi.

### Software

To let the LED blink the following SmallBASIC program can be used.

```smallbasic
import gpio

gpio.Open()
gpio.SetOutput(4)

for ii = 1 to 10
  v = !v
  gpio.Write(4, v)
  delay(100)
next

print "done"
```

The plugin supports Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). Using this technique the intensity
of the LED can be tuned as shown in the next example. Connect a LED with a 1 KOhm
resistor to pin 12 (PWM0)
' and pin 6 (GND)

```smallbasic
import pwm

' Initialize 
pwm.open("pwmchip0")
pwm.Period(1000000)         ' in ns -> 1kHz
pwm.DutyCycle(0)            ' Active time in ns  -> 0 = off
pwm.Enable()                ' enable pwm0

' Fade from dark to bright
for ii = 1 to 1000000 Step 10000
  pwm.DutyCycle(ii)
  delay(10)
next
```

## Push Buttons

Reading the state of a push button is for many Raspberry Pi project important and
really easy with SmallBASIC PiGPIO.

### Wiring

In the following image you see the wiring of a push button. When you press the button,
the circuit will be closed, otherwise the circuit is open. The button is connected to
pin 4 and ground of the Raspberry Pi. An internal pullup resistor will be enabled
automatically.

### Software

To read the state of the button, the following example program can be used.

```smallbasic
import gpio

gpio.Open()
gpio.SetInput(4)

while(1)
  print gpio.Read(4)
  delay(500)
wend
```

## OLED Display

In case the Raspberry Pi is used without a big screen, it would be great to have a
small display to print information or even show nice graphics. The plugin supports
SSD1306 compatible OLED displays (quite common and really cheap).

### Wiring

For running this example, you need a SSD1306 compatible OLED display. OLEDs with
128x64 or 128x32 pixels are supported. SmallBASIC-PiGPIO is using the I2C-protocol
for communication.

### Software

The following example shows how to use basic graphic commands to draw lines or print
text.

```smallbasic
import ssd1306

const ADDRESS = 0x3C

Print "Connect to SSD1306 OLED display"
ssd1306.Open("/dev/i2c-1", ADDRESS)
Print "Connection established"

delay(2000)
ssd1306.Cls()
ssd1306.Circle(25, 40, 16, 1, true)
ssd1306.At(50,5): ssd1306.Print("I2C with", 1)
ssd1306.At(50,14): ssd1306.Print("SMALLBASIC", 1)
ssd1306.line(0, 0, 127, 63)
ssd1306.rect(0,0,127,63)

' Transfer framebuffer to display
s = ticks
ssd1306.Display()
print ticks - s
delay(2000)

' Set brightness
ssd1306.SetBrightness(20)
delay(1000)
ssd1306.SetBrightness(255)
delay(1000)

' Display on/off
ssd1306.DisplayOff()
delay(1000)
ssd1306.DisplayOn()
delay(1000)

' Set inverse
ssd1306.InvertDisplay()
delay(1000)
ssd1306.InvertDisplay()

print "done"
```

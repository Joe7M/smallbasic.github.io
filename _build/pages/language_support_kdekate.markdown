# SmallBASIC in KDE Kate

_"The KDE Advanced Text Editor, or Kate, is a source code editor developed by the KDE free software community.
It has been a part of KDE Software Compilation since version 2.2, which was first released in 2001. Intended 
for software developers, it features syntax highlighting, code folding, customizable layouts, regular expression
support, and extensibility"

## Setup Syntax Highlighting and Coloring

The file for syntax highlighting can be downloaded from [Github](https://github.com/Joe7M/smallbasic.kate.syntaxcoloring/)

Copy the file "smallbasic.xml" into the folder "~/.local/share/org.kde.syntax-highlighting/syntax/".
Most probably this folder does not exist. Please create it. Restart Kate and chose "SmallBASIC" for highlighting.

<p>This chapter is designed to give you an overview over SmallBASIC and lets you determine whether the language suits your needs.</p>
<h2 id="two-words-of-caution">Two Words of Caution</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>This booklet is about the SmallBASIC programming language – it’s <em>not</em> an introduction to programming in general. While not a lot of software background is expected from the reader, it is assumed that common programming concepts are already understood.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Some knowledge in programming languages like »C«, Pascal, or Ruby is useful.</p></li>
<li><p>SmallBASIC is a language with a long and varied history. Some features which are still present in its code are no longer actively supported. These deprecated features may be removed in future releases, and, to keep the Vademecum concise, they will not be dealt with in this document.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="features-or-is-it-for-me">Features, or: Is it for me?</h2>
<p>SmallBASIC started life as something like an »extended handheld calculator«, designed for PIMs<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> running the Palm OS. One release note read, It’s not meant to be a full-fledged programming language, and it will never be. Please don’t ask us to turn it into one.</p>
<p>Some time has gone by since, and <em>Nicholas Christopoulos</em> and <em>Chris Warren-Smith</em>, the driving forces behind the project, have developed SmallBASIC into a dialect of the BASIC language which is neither »small« (in the sense of it’s capabilities), nor does it share too much with classic BASIC dialects.<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Today, some of SmallBASIC’s features are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>SmallBASIC is a multi-platform BASIC language: Currently, Linux, Windows and Android are supported.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>The language is pretty compact: The Debian installer for Linux, for example, comes as a single file with ca. 600 kb.</p></li>
<li><p>SmallBASIC features a very comprehensive set of mathematical functions.</p></li>
<li><p>It is an interpreted language with no compilation runs required.</p></li>
<li><p>SmallBASIC supports structured programming, user-defined structures and modularized source files. It is not object-oriented, though.</p></li>
<li><p>It also shows much leeway in questions of syntax: For many commands, there are alternatives, and for many constructs, there are different synonyms available.</p></li>
<li><p>SmallBASIC comes with its own little IDE.</p></li>
<li><p>Graphics primitives (like lines, circles, etc.) are provided, as well as sound and simple GUI functions.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>
<p>Here you will find a few internet resources that might be helpful for you when you want to get more closely acquainted with :</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://smallbasic.github.io/" class="uri">http://smallbasic.github.io/</a> is the central hub for information about SmallBASIC in general – a good starting point for a user of SmallBASIC. It leads you to the download of the current SmallBASIC versions and provides a lot of background information.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/smallbasic/SmallBASIC/" class="uri">https://github.com/smallbasic/SmallBASIC/</a> hosts the source code and cutting-edge SmallBASIC releases – most interesting if you want to contribute to the further development of SmallBASIC.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/12117250426/" class="uri">https://www.facebook.com/groups/12117250426/</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/SmallBASIC/110997952286349" class="uri">https://www.facebook.com/pages/SmallBASIC/110997952286349</a> are two Facebook groups dedicated to SmallBASIC. (Both don’t exactly swamp you with traffic either.)</p></li>
<li><p>You can get directly in touch with the developing team of SmallBASIC through <a href="mailto:smallbasic@gmail.com">e-mail</a>.</p></li>

<li id="fn1"><p>If you’re struggling with terms like »strings«, »loops«, or »pointers«, this booklet might not be for you.<a href="#fnref1" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn2"><p>»Personal Information Manager« – for you youngsters out there, that’s a smartphone without connectivity.<a href="#fnref2" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn3"><p>On a completely unrelated tangent, I’m convinced that one of the reasons BASIC has become much less popular today than many of the more strictly standardized languages like »C«, Python, or Ruby, is that though there actually <em>is</em> a standard for the language, it never has really been implemented. Rather, every BASIC dialect shows its own strengths and shortcomings, and one never really knows what one gets when one toys with a new dialect. This is one of the charms of working with BASIC, but of course it makes maintaining or porting software written in that language a nightmare. Back to our scheduled programme.<a href="#fnref3" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
<li id="fn4"><p>Older ports for Palm OS, DOS, and several others are no longer actively maintained. While some of these versions are still around, they may miss many of the features described here.<a href="#fnref4" class="footnote-back">↩</a></p></li>
